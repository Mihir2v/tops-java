/*Main OOP Concept:
 * 
 * 1. Class - It's a Group of Different type of Variables &         Function. It's Collection of Objects 
 * 
 * 2. Object - Instance of class.
 * 
 * 3.Inheritance - The Object of One Class Acquire the properties of the object of another class is called inheritance. or creating a new class is called inheritance.
 *
 * Types of Inheritance :
 * 	 1. Single
 * 	 2. Multilevel
 * 	 3. Multiple - Not Supported
 * 	 4. Hierarchy
 * 	 5. Hybrid - Not Supported
 * 
 *  4. Polymorphism 
 *  
 *  	1. Compile Time(Method Overloading) - When there is a more than one method in a single class having the same name but with different number of argument and their data types, than it is called method overloading.
 *  
 *  	2.Run Time (Method Overriding) - When there is same method prototype in your both base class & derive class, and if you call that method using the object of derived ,class then only derived class method will be called to you can say that method of derive class overrides the method of base calss.
 *  
 *  5. Abstraction : Data hiding
 *  
 *  6. Encapsulation : To bind a data and code in to a single unit is called encapsulation.
